*Abstract:*

Our project consists of an updated architecture of Case Cash, meal swipes, and the student employee payment system.  These systems are old and developed in a way that is not cohesive and can provide a lot of issues for students as they interact with them regularly.  Our solution streamlines all three systems into one application that will provide functionality in line with viewing the status of meal swipes, easily converting money into Case Cash, and providing students with a connected checking account for direct deposits from student employment as well as possible integration with the CWRU Bookstore.  This project is meant to be a proof of concept and will have all of the necessary components to function, but will not be utilizing real money or deposits as that requires a level of compliance and clearance that is not within the scope of the senior project.  This project will function as it will be downloadable and configurable to set up example accounts that can interact with the system at large.

## Quickstart Guide

1. Clone into the repository
2. Run ```npm install``` in the repository folder
3. Run ```expo start``` to run the app in an emulator

Command one by one:
```
git clone https://github.com/jawiseberg/spartan-bank.git
cd spartan-bank
npm install
expo start
```

This should work perfectly if you have react native setup, if not open the project in VS Code, get the React Native extension and follow the steps to get fully setup to develop and test the app on an emulator.
